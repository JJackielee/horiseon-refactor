# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

Horiseon is a marketing agency that helps with Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Managment and Social Media Marketing. The website explains why each of these services are important and how Horiseon tackles these topics. The idea of this topic is help clients/customers understand the work behind marketing and why it is important. 

What I learned from building/refactoring this website is the importance of semantics. I changed most of the DIV tags to a more appropriate tag like section, header, footer, aside, figure etc. I also learned to include alt attributes for better accessibilites for all users. I built this project to help me understand efficient usage of semantics and descriptive details of each elements.
